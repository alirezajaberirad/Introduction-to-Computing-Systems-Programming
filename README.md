# Introduction-to-Computing-Systems-Programming
C programming and some basic knowledge of programming were taught in this course at the faculty of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Tehran - Fall 2017

## CA1 - PacMan
In this assignment, the PacMan game was designed and implemented in the environment of command prompt. This computer assignment had three phases. 
In phase 0, the algorithm flowchart for designing the PacMan character and playground was designed using Microsoft Visio.

In phase 1, the static view of the PacMan character by entering three variables by the user, 1. direction of PacMan, 2. radius of PacMan character, and 3. how much its mouth be opened in degrees was implemented in C language. Also, a basic view of the playground using three user inputs, 1. length of each cell, 2. number of rows, and 3. number of columns was implemented in the C language.

In phase 2, the entire game was designed and implemented. You can try compile and running this code and enjoy playing the game!!!

## CA2 - Find & Replace
In this assignment, a program for finding and replacing a phrase in a text file was designed and implemented in the C language.

## CA3 - Restaurant Management System
In this project, a program was designed and implemented for managing a restaurant. The main menu of this program has three branches: 1. food, 2. orders, and 3. customers

In the food branch, you can add any food that you want it to be in your food menu. Also, you can print the menu or search for food on the menu.

In the orders branch, you can add and remove an order that you want by its order number. Also, you can see all of the orders simultaneously by choosing “print orders”.

In the customers branch, you can insert a new customer to the list, also you can search for a customer in the list by typing its username, and also you can see all the customers listed in alphabetic order.
